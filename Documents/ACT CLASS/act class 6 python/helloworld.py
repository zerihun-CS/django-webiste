# Python is a stunning programming language.
# It's simple to pick up and play, with clear and short grammar (rules).
# Python is a popular choice for novices, but it's also strong enough to run some of the world's
# most popular products and services, including those from NASA, Google, IBM, Cisco, Microsoft, and Industrial Light & Magic.



# The Python print() function takes in any number of parameters, and prints them out on one line of text.
# The items are each converted to text form, separated by spaces, and there is a single '\n' at the end (the "newline" char).
